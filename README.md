>"Within C++ is a smaller, simpler, safer language struggling to get out."

* [C++ Core Guidelines](CppCoreGuidelines.md)
  * collaborative C++ guidelines language  
    * AFTER many person-years of
      * discussion
      * design 

## Getting started

* [GH-flavored MarkDown](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
  * Reasons: ðŸ§  
    * kept simple (MOSTLY in ASCII)
    * allow automatic post-processing (_Example:_ language translation & reformatting) ðŸ§ 
* [This repo / version formatted for browsing](http://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
  * MOST updated is version | master branch
    * Reason: ðŸ§ MANUALLY integrated | browser ðŸ§  
* versioning
  * constantly evolving / strict "release" cadence
    * see [tagging](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/releases)
  * Bjarne Stroustrup periodically reviews the document  
* header-only Guidelines Support Library
  * is used
  * _Example of an implementation:_ [GSL: Guidelines Support Library](https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL)

## Background and scope

* goal
  * help to use modern C++ effectively
    * modern C++ == effective use of ISO C++ standard == C++11+
  * uniform style ACROSS code bases
  * higher-level issues 
    * _Example:_ interfaces, resource management, memory management, and concurrency
    * -> NO concern low-level issues
      * _Example:_ naming conventions and indentation style
  * rules about application architecture & library design
    * benefits 
      * code statically type-safe,
      * NO resource leaks,
      * catches MANY MORE programming logic errors
      * run fast
      * faster/easier initial development
    * if you want to upgrade old systems -> it's hard
* set of rules
  * emphasizes safety & simplicity
  * designed -- to be supported by an -- analysis tool
