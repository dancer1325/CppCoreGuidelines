* C++ compilers
  * ❌NOT make concrete recommendations❌ 
    * Reason:🧠
      * take parts | commercial wars
      * NOT know every C++ compiler🧠
  * recommendation
    * compiler / 
      * follow ISO standard
      * supply a standard library's solid implementation
  * MOST are embedded | frameworks -- of -- software development tools & libraries
  * check
    * run-time performance implications
