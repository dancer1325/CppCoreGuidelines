# how to migrate from C -- to -- C++?

* TODO:

# C vs C++?

* C++
  * == 👀“a better C”👀
    * Reason:🧠
      * 's type checking -- stronger than -- C 's type checking
        * -> WIDER range of programming styles
      * MORE notational support 🧠
  * == 💡direct descendant of C95 (== C90 + Amendment) 💡
    * C95 == subset
    * == 👀BETTER way -- to express -- C95👀
  * supports
    * data abstraction,
    * OOP,
    * generic programming
  * use cases
    * MOSTLY one
      * ⚠️EXCEPT TO, FEW environments / support for C++ is weak⚠️
  * C++ is not a descendant of C99; rather, both are derived from C95

* C++11
  * vs C99’s
    * adopted ALL preprocessor extensions & library extensions
    * NOT ’s new language features
      * _Example:_ `restrict` keyword 
        * NOT used
        * EXIST | C99
