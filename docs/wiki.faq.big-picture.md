# What's C++?

* C++
  * == general-purpose programming language
  * [better than C](wiki.faq.c.md#c-vs-c)
  * supports
    * [data abstraction](#whats-so-great-about-classes)
    * [OOP](#whats-the-big-deal-with-oo)
    * [generic programming](#whats-the-big-deal-with-generic-programming)
    * functional programming
      * _Example:_ template metaprogramming, lambda functions, `constexpr`
  * defined -- by an -- [ISO standard](#is-c-standardized)
    * ->
      * stability
      * large user community

# What’s so great about classes?

* Classes
  * == idea == concept 
  * allows you,
    * organize your code
      * -> avoid making mistakes 
    * reason about your programs
      * _Example:_ comprehend relationships among data items & functions 
  * ' object
    * == Example of the idea

* TODO:
* well-designed class presents a clean and simple interface to its users, hiding its representation and saving its users from having to know about that representation
* If the representation shouldn’t be hidden – say, because users should be able to change any data member any way they like – you can think of that class as “just a plain old data structure”;
